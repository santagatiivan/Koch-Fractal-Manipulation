# Contributing to Koch Fractal Explorer
I welcome your interest! Making contributions to this project as easy and transparent as possible is my priority, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Here's how you can make one:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Ensure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## All contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/santagatiivan/Koch-Fractal-Manipulation.git)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/santagatiivan/Koch-Fractal-Manipulation/issues/new); it's that simple!
